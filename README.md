# Ansikten

Face recognition tool for event photography.

---

## What is this?

Ansikten helps photographers identify and rename people in large collections of RAW images (NEF). It consists of:

- **Backend** - Python CLI for batch processing + FastAPI server
- **Frontend** - Electron workspace for interactive review

The tool is designed for sports events, school activities, or any context where many people appear across multiple photos.

## Quick Start

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Process images
./hitta_ansikten.py 2024*.NEF

# Rename based on detected faces
./hitta_ansikten.py --rename --processed .
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build:workspace
npx electron .
```

Backend auto-starts on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`
